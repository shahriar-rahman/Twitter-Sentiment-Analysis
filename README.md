# **Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis**
An automated windows application, capable of sifting through user's tweets to analyze the overall sentiment.

## **Abstract**
Nowadays, the social media sites such as twitter has become popular for people sharing their opinions and feelings. However, words can be structured in a complex method which would make it near impossible to detect the true sentiment value behind a tweet. Moreover, there are a myriad of slangs and trendy phrases that are being used to further make the effort of sentiment analysis more complicated. The primary incentive of this application is to construct an automated AI Systems capable of sifting through large chunks of tweets and, using tokenization and text polarity detection systems, be able to detect a user's sentiment over a single tweet. Additionally, the system is being calibrated to also detect every single tweet and visualize the overall results as well as create a psychological profile that would be beneficial in many sectors such as mental therapy, automated crime detection, and a plethora of other medical professions.
